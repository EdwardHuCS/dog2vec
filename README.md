# My First Machine Learning Project
I found a fun dataset about the dogs of Zurich, Switzerland on Kaggle.
I will build figures, classifiers, and other fun data related things around this dataset.
I will be using __Tensorflow__, __Numpy__, and __Pandas__.
# Pandas / matplotlib warmup
Located in `stats.py`, shows trending dogs and information about their owners

# Linear classifier
Classifies the gender of the owner based on dog features.

# Neural Network classifier
Work in progress

# Dataset Notes
Since German is the official language of Zurich most of the columns are in German but the translations to English aren't too tricky

1. ALTER -> Age
2. GESCHLECHT -> Gender
3. STADTKREIS -> City Quarter or District
4. RASSE1 -> Dog's Primary Breed
5. RASSE2 -> Dog's Secondary Breed
6. GEBURTSJAHR_HUND -> Dog's Year of Birth
7. GESCHLECHT_HUND -> Dog's Gender
8. HUNDEFARBE -> Dog's Color
